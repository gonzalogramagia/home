# ✍️ Local

**Minimalist note-taking application designed for persistent browser-based storage.**

"Local" is a privacy-focused tool built to help you stay productive without your data ever leaving your device. Everything you write is stored directly in your browser's local storage—no servers, no tracking, just your notes.

    - URLs are automatically turned into clickable links.
